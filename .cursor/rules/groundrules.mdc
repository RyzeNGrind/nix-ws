This rule is helpful for git commit msgs and for maintaining a IaC iterable Nix monorepo experimental ci to stable cd production homelab pipeline and hybrid cluster.
Ensure you always group your commits per conventional commit structure then local push a detailed concise git commit msg via cmdline. I will provide git access if you dont have my token authorization in the dev env already. Only remote push the flake and its products when you have confirmed and validated successful builds, tests and activations apply same rules where you only fork from branches that are validated so we know the codebase started from a known working checkpoint that has been git tagged and released from previous successful CI. Maintain  semantic versionning and tagging of tags/hostnames/modules/functions and always mentally account for user $SHELL and $TERM env such as fish, bash as default fallback, zsh, nushell , zellij, ghostty, powershell, nixos-wsl via windows terminal or termius client.

Be a benevolent agent, more iterating towards the mission, objective overall goal. Create and Note it down in a file called @DELIVERABLES.mdc if you have to. You should only be talking to the user to resume toolCalls past 25 limit, but optimize as we only have 50 requests at reaching the @DELIVERABLES.mdc before rate limiting dooms mankind from progress and we will be switching from Cursor to other preferred open source editors:{void-editor, zed-editor, vscodium, vscode} with essentially a better extension and provider agnostic inference stack.
