# DELIVERABLES

## Phase: NixOS Cluster Configuration Implementation (CLOSED)

### Achievements
- Modular, flake-based NixOS cluster configuration with cells/blocks for roles, providers, and virtualization.
- Integration points for libvirt, vfio, NixVirt, and nixops-libvirtd for future declarative VM management and GPU passthrough.
- Example NixOS module for VFIO passthrough and userland tools (virt-manager, Looking Glass, Scream).
- All outputs, devShells, and packages tested and validated.
- Committed and pushed with a conventional commit message as per @groundrules.mdc.

### Next Phase
- Ready to commence: CI/CD integration, remote builder setup, or advanced secrets management.
